    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd daccotta
    ```

### Installing Bun

**Bun** is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime we use to manage both the frontend and backend. You'll need to install Bun before proceeding with any setup.

#### For macOS:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to install Bun:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash -s "bun-v1.1.27"
    ```

3. Restart all your terminals after installing bun.

#### For Windows:

To install, paste this into a powershell (run powershell as administrator):

```bash
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
```

or paste this

```bash
npm install -g bun
```

**Restart all your terminals after installing bun inclduing vscode.**

### 🖥️ Frontend-Only Setup

If you only want to contribute to the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the client folder:

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    bun i
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and paste the following content:

    ```
    VITE_ACCESS_KEY= "your tmdb key"
    VITE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDp5LFFF9TU9W1LzB0Cus--lxBawNyBc5Q
    VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN=mock-daccotta.firebaseapp.com
    VITE_PROJECT_ID=mock-daccotta
    VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET=mock-daccotta.appspot.com
    VITE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=586345450139
    VITE_APP_ID=1:586345450139:web:84f82ab90882cd0fe4143e
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://daccotta-5loj.onrender.com
    ```

4. You still need to setup your tmdb account and get an API key from them , its free and takes just 5 mins. refer to their [docs](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). if you still face any issues contact to the maintainers of the repo we may be able to provide you with a test key.

5. Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```

6. Your frontend should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.
